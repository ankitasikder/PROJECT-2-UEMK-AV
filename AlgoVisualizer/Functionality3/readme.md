## About this part :point_down: 

<div align="justified">
            
*It is the 3rd functionality of my project.* Messaging apps are apps and platforms that enable instant messaging. Many such apps have developed into broad platforms enabling status updates, chatbots, payments and conversational commerce (e-commerce via chat). They are normally centralised networks run by the servers of the platform's operators, unlike peer-to-peer protocols like XMPP. The DISCUSSION part will take the user to a login page where he has to give username and password (firebase-provided password in home page). Then he will be added in a discussion group for doubt clearing where I will answer his questions regarding this website. Here user can send messages and images in chat. Click on discussions. Here user has to enter his username and password (firebase-provided password in home page). Then he will be added in a discussion group for doubt clearing where the developers will answer his questions regarding this website.

## Why I have made this :point_down:

<div align="justified">
            
Discussion is important for any queries of user. Group discussion on study topics plays vital role in understanding the topic. Discussing a topic with friends or classmates helps in learning the topic with perfection. Group discussion on a topic involves sharing of learning by the participants which equally benefits all the participants. I have made this to make study easier. When developers guide the user properly it will very helpful for the user to explore the web site and study algorithms.
